# P-adics
P adic numbers are a way of representing integers by mapping them to decimal numbers that are repeating. The "p" part represents a prime number that we can expand our number in. 

Here is how we go from a regular, base 10 integer to a p-adic number: 

* df
* dfd
* fdf
* dfd

## The goal 
The goal of this project was to create an object called a _Padic_, similar to an Integer but with different methods. I based a lot of the code from the source code of [the Integer object](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/lang/Integer.java) in Java 8.
